        **Car Price Prediction Model**

        Developed a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features like make, model, year, and mileage. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The model achieved high accuracy and is available for integration into car dealership websites or applications for price estimation.
